# Career Outcomes for Post-Doctoral Students
## Background

According to the [National Postdoctoral Association](https://www.nationalpostdoc.org/page/What_is_a_postdoc), a "postdoc" is is an "individual holding a doctoral degree who is engaged in a temporary period of mentored research and/or scholarly training for the purpose of acquiring the professional skills needed to pursue a career path of his or her choosing." In other words, they are engaging in research and/or training at a university in order to decide what they want to pursue as a career. Thus, it would be helpful to see what career paths postdocs from different departments at Johns Hopkins University pursue. This could help the career center effectively accomodate current postdoctoral students at Hopkins. Students who are, in essence, at a university while they decide where to go in terms of career.

Looking into some of the areas that postdocs pursue, such as academia, for-profit, goverment, non-profit willl prove useful. Additionally, looking into what type of role such as teaching or non- science related fields could provide useful to career centers.

A look into data from [Next Generation Life Science Coalition](http://nglscoalition.org/coalition-data/#close) will provide understanding on the different career paths that Hopkins postdocs from different departments pursue.

## Data Analysis 

First, a cluster analysis was conducted with 3 anchors. As the aim is to minimize the sum of the minimum distances between the anchors


1.__How does the data group itself into separate clusters?__

_Cluster 1_
It is the only cluster that is above average percent of postdocs going into for- profit and the only cluster with above average percent going into non-profit institutions. Although they are both less than one standard deviation above the average for both. 

On the other hand, it has the lowest average percent of postdocs going into academia, government, and teaching. For academia and teaching, it is more than one standard deviation below average going into those paths. This is related data point, as those who go into academia often go into teaching as well.

_Cluster 2_
It is the cluster with the most above average percent of postdocs going into teaching. Although they are both less than one standard deviation above the average for both.

Interestingly, it is significantly below average percent of postdocs going into academia; it is almost one standard deviation lower. So, perhaps those going into teaching are not pursuing teaching positions in academia, unlike what one would normally expect.

At almost one standard deviation below average going into for- profit institutions, cluster 2 is tied with Cluster 4 .

_Cluster 3_
It is the cluster with the most above average percent of postdocs going into academia. It is significantly above average percent of postdocs going into academia, at nearly one standard deviatioon above the mean. 

The percent of postdocs going into government is also above average at .65 standard deviations above. 


Below average going into for- profit.

Below average going into non-profit.

Slighty below average going into teaching. 

_Significantly below average going into non science related fields; it is almost one standard deviation lower. This is same average as cluster 1 and 3._


_Cluster 4_
This cluster has the most above average percent of postdocs going into government. It is nearly 2 standard deviations above the average. There is also an above average percent of postdocs going into academia, although it is not nearly as many as cluster 3.

Significantly below average going into for- profit. It is tied with Cluster 4 for most below average percent of post docs going into for-profit institutionos.

Significantly above average going into government. It is more than one standard deviation higher. It is the greatest above average percent of postdocs going into government.

Below average going into non-profit. It is tied with Cluster 2.

Slighty above average going into teaching. 

Significantly below average going into non science related fields. Among the four clusters, this cluster has the smallest below average.

## Summary
The analysis can help career centers figure out which resources and opportunities to provide postdoc students in different departments based on which career paths are more prevalent. It can also help employers figure out which departments to target for the greatest effectiveness.

Since there are many departments at Hopkins that house postdocs, the career center could implement four different subgroups within the career center in order to accomodate the four different groups of departments that tend to have similar career paths.

For departments in cluster 1, the career center could organize more for-profit and non-profit institutions to come to career fairs for those departments. Those at the career center could also reach out to more of these institutions to get them to come to events for these departments. On the other hand, the profit and non-profit employers could send more information or reach out to those departments in cluster 1 (perhaps through email) because more postdoc students seem to go into these fields compared to those in the other clusters. This would help concentrate their efforts for maximum benefit (ie. they would be reaching out to students that are more likely to pursue those paths). Going into for-profit and non-profit institutions were the most popular choices. This is also what differentiated this cluster from the others. More of the postdocs in this group chose those routes.

For departments in cluster 2, the career center could organize more workshops developing skills such as public speaking and effective ways to teach as they had the most postdoc students going into teaching compared to academia, for-profit, government, non-profit, and non-science related institutions, as well as compared to the other clusters.

As cluster 3 had the most above average percent of postdocs going into academia compared to the other clusters, the career center could make sure they send out information about universities and colleges. Some information about governmental institutions that are hiring would also benefit those departments because it had a little more than half of a standard deviation above average go into government as well. Academia and government were the most popular in cluster 3.

Going into government was the most popular choice for those in departments in cluster 4. It also had some people go into academia and teaching. The career center should make sure they have reach out to governmental institutions for potential job openings.

Furthermore, the career center could look into developing relationships with ___ in order to perhaps have people come in for panels that can better educate postdocs about the different avenues even within the potential career paths that they are drawn to.

By developing more specific initiatives with the career center, it could help postdocs more easily land jobs. it could help postdocs value their institution and more

Additional specific data on what kinds of non-profits or for-profits the postdocs pursue for would provide more detailed analysis. There are a lot of different kinds of nonprofits and for-profit institutions, so having a more detailed division of the percentage that go into each would provide useful analysis for career centers and employers alike. Furthermore, data on the specific companies that postdocs go to could help the career center find similar companies that are popular with the students
