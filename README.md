# Career Outcomes for Post-Doctoral Students
## Background

According to the [National Postdoctoral Association](https://www.nationalpostdoc.org/page/What_is_a_postdoc), a "postdoc" is is an "individual holding a doctoral degree who is engaged in a temporary period of mentored research and/or scholarly training for the purpose of acquiring the professional skills needed to pursue a career path of his or her choosing." In other words, they are engaging in research and/or training at a university in order to decide what they want to pursue as a career.

It would be interesting to see what career paths postdocs from different departments at Johns Hopkins University pursue. This could help the career center effectively accomodate current postdoctoral students at Hopkins.

Looking into common areas, such as academia, for-profit, goverment, non-profit willl prove useful. Additionally, looking into what type of role such as teaching could help as well, as well as the percentage going into non- science related fields.

A look into data from [Next Generation Life Science Coalition](http://nglscoalition.org/coalition-data/#close) will provide understanding on the different career paths that Hopkins postdocs from different departments pursue.

## Data Analysis 

Outline data analytics process


1.__How can we group our data?__

2.__How does the data group itself into 3 anchors?__

Cluster 1
Significantly above average going into academia. As can be seen in the graph, both clusters 2 and 3 have a below average number of students going into academia. 

Significantly below average going into for- profit; it is almost one standard deviation lower. It is the lowest out of the three clusters.

Below average going into government. 

Significantly below average going into non-profit. 

Slighty above average going into teaching. 

Slightly above average going into non-science related fields.

Cluster 2

Cluster 3

The simple linear regression line only accounts for approximately 3% (R squared value of .03) of the data, so a multiple linear regression was modelled.

_The three clusters are._ 


__Number of impressions = -331958 + 294 * amount spent + 8455 * days used.__


## Summary
The analysis can help political organizations more confidently predict how much to spend on an ad and how many days to use an ad to increase the number of impressions on 18-40 year olds, and thus its effectiveness on them. This confidence may lead more organizations to utilize Snapchat in posting ads, generating revenue for the company. Moreover, this analysis is particularly important and of use now. Given how close we are to election day, it could help organizations predict whether or not it is worth it to release ads now and whether they should possibly spend more, given the time constraint. The analysis shows that, for the future, there is a benefit to political organizations in rolling out these ads early. 
Finally, looking into other variables that could lower the standard error would help political organizations increase engagement with their election ads.
